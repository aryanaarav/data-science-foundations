# Simulation Using Python

This folder contains practice code and examples for simulations using Python, primarily based on Allen Downey's book *Modeling and Simulation in Python*.

## About the Book

*Modeling and Simulation in Python* by Allen Downey provides an introduction to computational modeling and simulation using Python. The book covers fundamental concepts in simulation, including:

- Modeling physical systems
- Differential equations
- Queuing theory
- Agent-based modeling
- Monte Carlo simulations

## Purpose

This repository serves as a practice space where concepts from the book are implemented and experimented with. It includes code snippets, exercises, and examples to reinforce learning.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy (install via `pip install numpy matplotlib scipy`)

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the `SimulationUsingPython` folder.
3. Run the Python scripts using `python script_name.py`.
4. Modify and experiment with the code to understand the simulations better.

## Contents

- `readme.md`: This file.

*(Add more files and descriptions as you add code examples.)*

## Acknowledgments
